**Passionate about coding, curiosity, and creativity.**

## About Me

I’m a third-year Computer Science student who loves to code and explore new technologies. My main strengths are in Python, C++, and working with data using libraries like NumPy, SymPy and Pandas. I also enjoy building websites and have experience with HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.

One of my favorite projects so far is an online yoga class booking platform, where I handled both the front end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and the back end (Django, Python).

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me singing or sketching. I believe creativity drives innovation, whether it’s in tech or the arts.
